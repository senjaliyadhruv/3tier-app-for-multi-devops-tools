# üõ†Ô∏è 3-Tier App Deployment Using Multiple DevOps Tools

This repository contains a reusable **3-tier application** (frontend, backend, database) that can be deployed and practiced using multiple DevOps tools and cloud provisioning methods. It is designed to be used as a base setup for learning and showcasing DevOps tools like:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Terraform on AWS (EC2 + EKS)
- Kubernetes (YAML)
- Jenkins Pipeline (CI/CD)

> Whether you're practicing containerization, infrastructure as code, or CI/CD pipelines ‚Äî this repo has you covered!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How This Repository Works

This repo provides a full-stack 3-tier application (React frontend + Node.js backend + MySQL database) and allows you to practice deploying it using multiple DevOps tools and techniques.

Each folder inside the repo maps to a specific tool or platform:

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `app/client/` | React frontend application |
| `app/backend/` | Node.js + Express backend API |
| `database/mysql/` | MySQL database Docker setup |
| `docker/` | Dockerfile, docker-compose, and container scripts |
| `jenkins/` | Jenkins pipeline (CI/CD) to deploy frontend & backend |
| `terraform/ec2/` | Deploy frontend/backend using Terraform on AWS EC2 |
| `terraform/eks/` | Deploy on AWS EKS cluster via Terraform |
| `kubernetes/` | Raw Kubernetes manifests for manual kubectl deployment |
| `assets/` | Architecture diagrams, screenshots, or GIFs |

You can pick any toolset you want to practice and use this repo to:
- Run locally with Docker
- Deploy to AWS via Terraform
- Use Jenkins CI/CD pipelines
- Practice raw K8s deployments

The app code stays the same. Only the **DevOps tooling** changes.
